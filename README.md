Titanic Survival Prediction

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains detailed information about passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. By exploring and analyzing the data, preprocessing it, and implementing machine learning models, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic Titanic voyage.
